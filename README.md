# Stage 2
**Udacity** Intro to Programming Nanodegree

## Programs
1. Age in Days - ```ageindays.py``` ```v1.0```
  - Asks for birthday and calculates user's age in days.
  - Written before seeing solution
  - Prematurely optimized.
  - ```python -c 'import ageindays; ageindays.test()```
2. Video Break - ```videobreak.py```
  - Opens a music video every two hours to remind user to take a beak.
  - Idea from [Udacity forum](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/take-a-break-mini-project/123310)
3. Mad Lib Generator - ```madlib.py```
  - Asks for input and generates a mad lib.
  - Randomly selects mad lib to generate.
4. **Final Project**: Fill in The Blank Quiz - `fill-in-the-blanks.py`
  - User enters the answers to fill-in-the-blank quiz.
  - [Docs](docs/fillintheblanks.md)

### Concepts Utilized
- Pseudocode
- Lists
- Conditional
- Loops
- Functions
- ```test()``` and ```assert()```
- User input
- Unit testing
- PEP 8 [Style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for python code

### Extra
- Dictionaries
- Dates and time
- ```if __name__ == '__main__':```
- Python documentation standards [[Google](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html)]

### Revised
- Function names to follow PEP8
- Variable names to be more descriptive
- Broke taketest() into smaller functions

### Interesting
- Why you don't deal with time and timezones - by Tom Scott [[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&list=TLBBCouWmde2kE6qFG90Fsn3GusE_aTr8k)]
